** To-do list for the section features and caveats in the README file:

Explain these:

- Mac users still need to install GNU Make 4+ and Bash as the versions
  provided by Apple are too old or missing mainly due to licensing issues.

- Automatic generated help message with phony targets human description

- This is done by parsing the GNU Make database and does not try to parse
  makefiles

- Provides a set of Bash functions and a common prologue that bring features to
  recipes
